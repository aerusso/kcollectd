# Overview

kcollectd is a graphical front-end to [collectd](https://collectd.org/),
a data collection service that monitors, by polling or pushed updates,
system information, such as temperature or free RAM.

kcollectd directly displays the data, which is stored in an round-robin
database.

# History
Many thanks to [M G Berberich](https://www.forwiss.uni-passau.de/~berberic/),
for originally writing kcollectd!  See the
[old site](https://www.forwiss.uni-passau.de/~berberic/Linux/kcollectd.html).

Note that the modern version of kcollectd available here has been ported to
Qt 5 and librrd8.
