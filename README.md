# Overview

kcollectd is a graphical front-end to [collectd](https://collectd.org/), a data
collection service that monitors, by polling or pushed updates, system
information, such as temperature or free RAM.  kcollectd provides a graphical
display of these collected statistics.

More generally, kcollectd can display the data stored in any round-robin
database (RRD).  Use the `--basedir` command line option to load RRDs from a
non-standard location.

# History
Many thanks to [M G Berberich](https://www.forwiss.uni-passau.de/~berberic/),
for originally writing kcollectd!  See the
[old site](https://www.forwiss.uni-passau.de/~berberic/Linux/kcollectd.html).

Note that the modern version of kcollectd available here has been ported to
Qt 5 and librrd8.
